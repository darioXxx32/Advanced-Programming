      âœ… Task 1.1 Reading and Discussion

      1. What is the output of this program?
         The output is:
         v1 size: 0
         v2 size: 4
         v3 size: 4

      2. Why does v1.size() return 0 after the move?
         After moving 'v1' to 'v3', the move constructor transfers 'v1's resources to 'v3'.
         This leaves 'v1' in a valid but empty state, so its size is 0.

      3. What does std::move do?
         'std::move' casts its argument to an rvalue reference, indicating that it is safe to move
         (transfer) the internal resources of the object instead of copying them.

      4. Why is v1 still in a valid but unspecified state?
         According to the C++ specification, after a move operation, the moved-from object
         ('v1') is in a valid state (meaning it can be destructed or assigned to),
         but its exact content is unspecified.

      Questions:
      - What constructors and assignments are called and when?
         * buf1: constructor.
         * buf2: copy constructor.
         * buf3: constructor then copy assignment.
         * buf4: move constructor.
         * buf5: constructor then move assignment.
      - What happens to the source object after a move?
         The source object is left in a valid but unspecified (typically empty) state.
      - What would happen if you didn't define the move constructor/assignment?
         The compiler might generate default ones, or fall back to copying, leading to inefficient operations.

/*
  Summary Questions:
  - What did you learn about move semantics?
      Move semantics allow for efficient resource transfer, avoiding expensive deep copies.
  - In what kinds of projects do you think this would matter?
      In projects that manage large data structures, resource-intensive objects, or real-time systems,
      move semantics can greatly improve performance.
  - What are some risks of using std::move incorrectly?
      Using std::move incorrectly can lead to resource leaks, undefined behavior, or using objects in an invalid state.
